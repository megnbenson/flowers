    <p>The lockdown changed quite o bit of everything <br>
and this is good <br>
good to remind ourselves that we're capable of change <br>
its clear that change is needed, that we are ready for it <br>
that those who have more privilege <br>
those who profit off a biased system <br>
need to take a stance of active listening <br>
to past and present pain <br>
for better present and future systems <br>
 <br>
with a flower, what do you look to first? <br>
what draws you in?<br>
the petals, the smell, the flash, the beauty <br>
and the flash is great and all but <br>
it distracts from the whole <br>
it hides the working cogs <br>
the stalk and sepal that hold the flower head up <br>
it hides the receptacle that protects the organs <br>

pre lockdown I was looking into care, and lack there of <br>
particularly for maintenance workers online and off <br>
even through lockdown we were celebrating the key workers, <br>
the workers highlighted as critical to running our sociey, <br>
the cogs that keep everything smooth sailing <br>
and then in the same line, given no resources, <br>
many were forced to go in as they couldn't afford not to, <br>
care wasn't given <br>
those that keep us together are most at risk and least cared for <br>
how does that work? <br>

we, the profiteers, were too busy looking at the flash <br>
baking banana bread and sourdough starters, <br>
I mean we're not even distracted by the flash, <br>
we are the flash. we deem ourselves to be the petals <br>
we get away with being distracted by our own matter(s) <br>
at the expense of those holding our hands and driving our buses <br>
but lack of care for them, <br>
is our problem as only we can sort it out <br>
begin to de-tangle, de-stress, de-escalate <br>
merge, melt, mix the structure <br>

are we ready to listen actively to those who are hurting? <br>
to no longer condone a system that is biased to the flash? <br>
complicit in our privilege, in our apathy <br>
is it possible to just peel away the violence? <br>
it is possible - the most efficient way to do something is to do it <br>
is it possible to melt white ego? <br>
it is possible - the most efficient way to do something is to do it <br>
is it possible for the petals to bloom, <br>
to give back, to oil our cogs, <br>
to solder the broken, <br>
to wake up and smell the goddamn roses</p>
